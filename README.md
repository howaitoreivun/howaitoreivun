  ### Hello 👋
  
  I'm currently a student of business informatics who's trying to learn more about programming and people. Even though I'm studying in an economics direction, I'm more interested in computer science. 
  
  So far I've been learning different languages, such as JavaScript (including TypeScript and Node), Java and Kotlin, C++ and Rust, but still, Python is my favourite one.
  
  One of my biggest accomplishments was getting the Discord Bug Hunter badge in 2019, it took me some time, but I'm glad to have this experience.
